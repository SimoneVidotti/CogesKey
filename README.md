# Coges-key 

## Description
As part of our studies in computer science and telecommunications, we are keen to explore real-world applications of our knowledge. 
This repository serves as a platform for us to document our findings and methodologies as we investigate the security features of the Coges-sticks 
used in our school. Our primary goal is to assess the robustness of the security measures implemented in these devices. By identifying potential 
vulnerabilities, we aim to understand how these weaknesses could be exploited and, more importantly, how they can be mitigated. 
This project not only allows us to apply theoretical concepts learned in class but also enhances our practical skills in cybersecurity.
We believe that ethical hacking and security testing are critical components of technology development. By conducting this research, 
we hope to contribute valuable insights that can help improve the security of such devices in educational settings, ensuring that students' resources 
are protected and that the integrity of the system is maintained. Through this repository, we will share our methodologies, findings, and any tools 
we develop along the way, fostering an open dialogue within the community and encouraging others to learn from our experiences.
